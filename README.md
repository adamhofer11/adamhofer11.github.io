>##### An insight to my life

## **Student**
I am a student at the Universtiy of Missouri Studying IT, on track to graduate in the spring of 2025.
>I chose information technology because I wanted to pursue my technology obsession and help innovate new forms of technology. As I am still very new to this path, we have begun to work in Python and have started JavaScript. Below is a volume calculator project, in python, I have completed this semester.

```#Welcoming
print("Welcome, this program is here to help calculate the volume of specific shapes.")
print("This program can calculate the volume of cones, cylinders and cubes.")

#User input
shape = (input("What shape would you like to use?"))

if shape == "cone":
    cone_radius = float(input("What is the radius?"))
    cone_height = float(input("What is the height?"))

    cone_volume=3.14*cone_radius*cone_radius*(cone_height/3)
    print(cone_volume)

elif shape == "cylinder":
    cylinder_radius = float(input("What is the radius?"))
    cylinder_height = float(input("What is the height?"))

    cylinder_volume = 3.14*cylinder_radius*cylinder_radius*cylinder_height
    print(cylinder_volume)

elif shape == "cube":
    cube_length = float(input("What is the length?"))

    cube_volume = cube_length*cube_length*cube_length
    print(cube_volume)

else:
    print("Error: Program can not find volume.")
```

I am in the fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi, where we all work to better ourselves by:
> - Building friendships that will last a lifetime.
> - Hold eachother countable and to high standards.
> - Meeting and building great connections and expanding knowledge.
> - Learning how to take leadership actions through positions on the board.

## **Personal Hobbies**
> #### Sports
> > > I love to watch the St. Louis Cardinals or the Blues whenever I get the chance. Those have been my two favorite sports teams for as long as I can remember. Some of my favorite memories are being a kid at Busch Stadium.
> > #### Snow skiing
> > > For a person who has lived in Missouri their whole life, I am obsessed with it. I have gone every winter for 14 years, and for the past couple years I have gone on every break I have. 
> > #### Video Games
> > > Video games have been a staple to my life for a long time. One of my earliest memories is getting the Playstation 2 for my 4th birthday. Any free time I have is usually spent playing games. I play all sorts of games but competitive multiplayers are my favoirte. Having a very competitive mindset drove me to try to become the best of best. Which I never quite made it there but, I have reached up to top 3% in the world in games that have over 350 million active players. Video games is actually the whole reason why I know anything about how a computer works. It was video games that drove me to learn how computers work so I could build one myself. I ended up building my first computer when I was 14. 

## **Inner self**
> I am not here to discuss religion or spiritual beliefes as that is personal information, and I respect everyones choice on that topic. However, I am a person who believes in actions over words, [seen in my philosophical statement below](####-Philosophical-Statement).
> #### Drive for Working Hard
> > Ever since I was a kid work was in my life. As a kid I hated all the chores my parents assigned to me, not till later in life I realized I am actually very fortunate for this. Doing all of the chores as a kid tought me that if a task five minutes or less, do it right then and there, everything else plan out get it done then continute on with our day. Then as sports came into my life I learned another factor of doing hard work. That is showing up everyday and putting in the hours. When I was finally the age to work a real job is when I learned what it meant to put my head down and go to work. At this age I was waking up at 5 A.M. going to football, then to work until 11 P.M. Taht is when I learned the final stage of being able to work hard, having a correct sleep schedule.
> #### Philosophical Statement
> > “Actions speak louder than words, and are more to be regarded.” - Mark Twain. I like this quote becuase, we can talk all we want but nobody notices until the action is taken. This quote helps motivate me to work hard, because I could sit down all day and say I am going to work hard and never actually do it, and that will not get me far. So I know I have to put the words into action or I will not succeed. Examples of actions I have taken is making a calendar for school, setting reminders on my phone and smart home system, sticking to a strict sleep schedule. Since I have started following this I have not a grade below 90%. 

## **Past Work**
> In my work experince I have learned great customer service skills, learned how to work more effienctly, and gained other skills.
#### **What's Up Dock** - _Boat Marina_
> Here I was a Dock Hand, my duties were:
> - Tie boats to dock and help them with any of their needs.
> - Deep clean the rental boats every night.
> - Check the rental boats back in, making sure there was no new damage and everything is still in the boat.
#### **Twin Oaks Golf Course** - _Country Club_
> My job title was a bag boy, my duties were the following:
> - Retrieve members clubs and have their cart ready for their round.
> - Clean members clubs after their round.
> - Keep the range in good condition. 
> - Clean and park the golf carts every night.

## **Future Goals**
> Like everyone I have goals that I want to achieve one day. As these goals in my life are my drive to do good in school.
#### Goals before I graduate:
> - Graduate with above a 3.4 in the spring of 2025
> - To get as many real world experiences in the information technology field.
#### Goals after I graduate: 
> - To land a job in Denver in the field of IT.
> - To try to enjoy my youth while I can.
#### The big picture:
> I would like to live a happy, non stressful life. For me that is being able to do what I love and experience the thing I like to do. By getting a job that I enjoy, in an area that I enjoy. While still getting to play video games and go snow skiing, that would be my American dream.
