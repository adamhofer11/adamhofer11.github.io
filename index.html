  <h2>Student Life</h2>
  <div id="student">
    <p> I am a student at the Universtiy of Missouri Studying IT, on track to graduate in the spring of 2025.
I chose information technology because I wanted to pursue my technology obsession and help innovate new forms of
 technology. As I am still very new to this path, we have begun to work in <i>Python</i> and have started <i>JavaScript</i>.
  Below is a volume calculator project, in <i>Python</i>, I have completed this semester.
</p>
</div>
<pre><code>print("Welcome, this program is here to help calculate the volume of specific shapes.")
print("This program can calculate the volume of cones, cylinders and cubes.")

#User input
shape = (input("What shape would you like to use?"))

if shape == "cone":
    cone_radius = float(input("What is the radius?"))
    cone_height = float(input("What is the height?"))

    cone_volume=3.14*cone_radius*cone_radius*(cone_height/3)
    print(cone_volume)

elif shape == "cylinder":
    cylinder_radius = float(input("What is the radius?"))
    cylinder_height = float(input("What is the height?"))

    cylinder_volume = 3.14*cylinder_radius*cylinder_radius*cylinder_height
    print(cylinder_volume)

elif shape == "cube":
    cube_length = float(input("What is the length?"))

    cube_volume = cube_length*cube_length*cube_length
    print(cube_volume)

else:
    print("Error: Program can not find volume.")</code></pre>
<p> I also have expanded my student life into the greek life system. In my fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi,
we all work together to better ourselves, by doing the following:</p>
<ui>
  <li>Building freindships that will last a lifetime.</li>
  <li>Meeting great connections and expanding our social network.</li>
  <li>Learning how to take responsibilities for our actions and, taking
    leadership responsibilities through positions on the board.</li>
    <li>Holding eachother accountable to our highest standard.</li>
  </ui>

    <h2>Personal Hobbies</h2>
    <div id="hobbies">
      <ui>
        <li>Sprots</li>
        <p>I love to watch the St. Louis Cardinals or the Blues whenever I get the chance.
           Those have been my two favorite sports teams for as long as I can remember.
            Some of my favorite memories are being a kid at Busch Stadium.</p>
        <li>Snow Skiing</li>
        <p>For a person who has lived in Missouri their whole life, I am obsessed
           with it. I have gone every winter for 14 years,and for the past
           couple years I have gone on every break I have.</p>
        <li>Video Games</li>
          <p>Video games have been a staple to my life for a long time.
             One of my earliest memories is getting the Playstation 2 for my
              4th birthday. Any free time I have is usually spent playing
               games. I play all sorts of games but competitive multiplayers
                are my favoirte. Having a very competitive mindset drove me to try to become the best of best.
                 Which I never quite made it there but, I have reached up to top 3% in the world in games that
                  have over 350 million active players. Video games is actually the whole reason why I know anything
                  about how a computer works. It was video games that drove me to learn how computers work so
                  I could build one myself. I ended up building my first computer when I was 14.</p>

  <h2>Innerself</h2>
  <div id="inner">
  <h5><b>I am not here to discuss religion or spiritual beliefes as that is personal information, and I respect
     everyones choice on that topic. However, I am a person who believes in actions over words.</b></h5>
     <ui>
       <li>Drive for Working Hard</li>
         <p>Ever since I was a kid work was in my life. As a kid I hated all the chores my parents assigned to me,
           not till later in life I realized I am actually very fortunate for this. Doing all of the chores as a kid
            tought me that if a task five minutes or less, do it right then and there, everything else plan out get
            it done then continute on with our day. Then as sports came into my life I learned another factor of
             doing hard work. That is showing up everyday and putting in the hours. When I was finally the age to
             work a real job is when I learned what it meant to put my head down and go to work. At this age I was
              waking up at 5 A.M. going to football, then to work until 11 P.M. Taht is when I learned the final
              stage of being able to work hard, having a correct sleep schedule.</p>
              <li>Philosophical Statement</li>
              <p> “Actions speak louder than words, and are more to be regarded.” - Mark Twain. I like this quote
                 becuase, we can talk all we want but nobody notices until the action is taken. I used this quote
                  a lot during my long <a href="hobbies">video game runs</a> as cliche that sounds. This quote helps
                 motivate me to work hard, because I could sit down all day and say I am going to work hard and
                  never actually do it, and that will not get me far. So I know I have to put the words into action
                   or I will not succeed. Examples of actions I have taken is making a calendar for school, setting
                    reminders on my phone and smart home system, sticking to a strict sleep schedule. Since I have
                     started following this I have not a grade below 90%.</p>
